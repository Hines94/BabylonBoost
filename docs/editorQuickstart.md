# Editor Quickstart
The editor is the home for creating scenes and objects to go in them. It is far faster than creating them by hand. You can create Prefabs, Materials, Datasheets and move/readjust items to fit the best.

> Simply use ./bbStartEditor.sh to start the editor

- Create folders and prefabs using a right click in the ContentBrowser
- Drag and drop assets around to move them about
- Double click any item to use it (eg double click prefab to open new Prefab window)
- Use the bar at the top for visualistaions and saving items etc
