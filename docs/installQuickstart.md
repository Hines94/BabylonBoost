# Install Quickstart
Installing BabylonBoost has been made with user experience in mind. Unfortunatly it runs best on WSL/Ubuntu so this is a tricky step to get right.  Once this is setup the rest of the process is easy!

## Steps
1. Install WSL2 (preferably with Ubuntu)
2. ./bbEngineSetup.sh
3. Setup an AWS S3 bucket [official docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html)
4. Setup an AWS access key [official docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user_manage_add-key.html)
5. Setup .env file (example as .env.sample)
6. Done! Optionally copy one of the example files or look [here](codeQuickstart.md) to get an idea on how to build!
